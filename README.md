# Algorithms-SortingAlgorithms-Analysis

1. Introduction:

The purpose of the project is to implement key sorting algorithms like Insertion sort, Merge Sort, In-place quick sort,modified quick sort to sort a list of elements and compare the performance of the algorithms for different input sizes

2. Approach:
Insertion sort, Merge sort, In-place Quick sort and modified Quick sort algorithms are implemented using object-oriented programming. The input array is generated with random elements according to the input size defined by the user.

3. Implementation

3.1. Programming language: The algorithms are implemented using java
programming (IntelliJ IDE)

3.2. Methods in implementation:

insertionSort() Contains Insertion sort algorithm tosort the elements

mergeSort() Contains Merge sort algorithm to sortthe elements

inPlaceQuickSort() Contains In-place Quick sort algorithm to sort the elements

modifiedQuickSort() Contains modified Quick sort algorithm to sort the elements

qPartition() and qSort() To make partitions and sort the list recursively during quick sort

quickSortMedianOfThreePartition() To choose pivot using median of three

mDivide() and mSort() To divide and sort the elements recursively during merge sort

generateRandArray() To generate random, sorted and reverse sorted arrays as per size defined by user

displayArray() To display array elements on console
